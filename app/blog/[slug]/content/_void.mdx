Hello, world! We are CorteXIDE, an open-source AI code editor forked from Void IDE. 

[This is really bad, it sounds vengeful. -Mat]
Cursor is a popular AI code editor, but last year they [privatized their codebase](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/commit/7815030980dea1245c05d4bbc28575746a1e40e4) and went closed-source.
This means you can't self-host your own models on Cursor, which is a big loss for open source AI. It also raises natural privacy concerns,
and it leads to a poor UX: if you can't see the prompt you're sending to the model, it's hard to tell what's going on.


We think what Cursor got right was being a standalone code editor. 
Other AI tools today like Copilot and Codeium are extensions, not editors, which makes them limited in scope and less natural to use. 


Open-sourcing an editor is a win for everyone: developers get access to latest AI productivity features,
and creators of AI tools can easily integrate with CorteXIDE to reach a larger audience.

Writing code is new on the timescale of humanity, and the way we do it will change drastically in the coming years.
We are incredibly excited about working on CorteXIDE, and you can help us out by becoming a contributor or joining the community.
