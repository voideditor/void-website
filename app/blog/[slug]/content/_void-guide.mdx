All these ideas are information we've gathered after working with VSCode for a few months.



The way you write most code in VSCode is by creating a class called a service. 
Most classes are only registered once (they're "singletons"). 
You'll see registerSingleton everywhere - this just lets you access the class from anywhere.
You always register a singleton by createDecorator and registerSingleton, 

The folder the code lives in like `common/`, `browser/`, `node/` dictates what imports they can access, and since you want node modules, you should use `node/` (or `electron-main/` which is just `node/` but with more).  


- Here's how we mount React  (react is just a framework, it's JS with nice state management)
- Settings are encrypted



## Services
VSCode doesn't use any frameworks to organize their code 
Instead, they organize their code into "Services". A service is just a class that's responsible for something. For example, the Metrics service
is responsible 


We only want one Metrics service to run, and this is a very common pattern. A class that only gets created and run once is called a "Singleton". You register 

registerSingleton(IMetricsService, MetricsService, )

Typically this is how you should mount any new services you create.

The interface

We find it annoying that you need to register the class and the interface since there's a lot of redundancy, but it's not a huge deal.

You can import a service using the 
@IMyService
this is called a dependency injection.


Sometimes you want to create multiple classes, like if you want to 
put a Widget somewhere ("Widgets" are the React Components of VSCode).
If you want to create a new class, you can use instantiationService.createInstance().
For example, instantiationService.createInstance(Class, Params);

It will automatically inject all the @IMyService dependencies. You could also use new Service(), but you need to manually provide all services it depends on.



## How VSCode is Organized



VSCode has 3 environments : common/, browser/


You see these all over the repo:

[[IMAGE]]

The name of the folder you're in tells you what environment you're in.

In VSCode, browser/ doesn't just mean web browser - it means frontend (like HTML). If you open VSCode on your Desktop, the HTML you see comes from browser/.
VSCode *can* run in web browsers, but this isn't called browser/, it's called "web" (web is not an environment, it's just terminology VSCode uses when dealing with web browsers). 

In order to run these environments, Electron creates two processes that run in parallel:
1. a user-facing process, which runs the environments on the left (browser and HTML-related items),
and 2. a backend process which runs environments on the right (node and backend-related items).

A huge majority of your code should live as a service in common/.

A note on imports: things in browser/ don't have access to node_modules, so if you want to import anything you have two options:

- bundle the node_module code and put it in the browser/ files. We do this for React.
- Import the node_module from inside node/ or electron-main/, and set up a simple API so browser/ can use it. 
This API idea sounds scary because it's called an "IPC proxy", but it's very simple, you just need to copy some boilerplace.


VSCode has a hierarchy of imports. It doesn't have as much meaning as environment, which actually dictates where the code runs.
The main idea is code organization. 
editor/ is Monaco editor - if you've ever typed code in the web, chances are you've used the Monaco editor. It's VSCode's editor that can run 

gulpfiles build all this stuff, and are torture to 

The most 








## organization

An editor (ICodeEditor) is the Monaco editor 


A model (ITextModel) is the representation of text underneath it 



There are two editors here :


Two editors are open with the same model, which is why changing text in the left changes it in the right. The model is the same 



When you switch tabs, the editor stays the same, it's just the model that changes. 
This was the most unintuitive part of working with VSCode for us - we thought a new editor would be created when you switch 
tabs, but it's the same editor.

Use editor.onDidChangeModel() to listen for tab changes.



A decoration is a highlight. You add it to a model, and it's there until you discard it (even if you switch tabs or close/reopen it in the editor).

A zone is a little area between lines. It lives on an individual editor at a time. 
You can only add a zone to one editor at a time.
This was really annoying to us, so we added a service that lets you add a zone to a model('s URI), the same way you do for a decoration. 
It's called "consistentItemService". We use it for some other things too.
